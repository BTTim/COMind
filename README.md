# COMind
 The primary goal of the Project COMind is to build a de-zentralised user data (encrypted sqlite database), 
 web assembly based Blazor WebApp with a Azrue SQL Server storing login and project data, that cuts out the Middleman between IT Developers and Company Projects, 
 by connecting them better, without the use of annoying blood-sucking recruiters taking 20% cuts, with life-long shackled contracts.

 The idea:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - There are "users" (Devs/Artists/etc. looking for projects) and "hardships" (company related projects) of "Employer" Accounts
 - User data stored locally, company data stored central
 - universal skill base pool and profession name pool, where each user can select his skills and filters
 - same pool for hardships for better mapping
 - Authentification through phone 2 FA Auth
 - Every User has to undergo a certification to see if real human. (Passport needed, maybe?)
 - both side can say how much pay/hour or how the contract should look like
 - according to these requirements, applications will be done automaticaly and companys will be notified. after accepting a candidate, the candidate will be notified.
 - This way there is no CV required, no Application needed, which is written by AI anyways.
 - The software will according to free dates on both sides (part of the mentioned filters) set a date for a zoom meeting
 - (maybe future feature: contracts are uniform and have to be digitally signed by both parties)

Possible Skills:
  - Every Programming language, Design, etc
